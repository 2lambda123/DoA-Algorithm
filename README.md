Title: Modeling and Simulation of Direction Finding Algorithm for Electronic Warfare

Abstract: In Electronic Warfare (EW) Systems,Estimation of Angle of Arrival
(AoA) of threat radar signal is an important operational functional-
ity.In a dense radar threat scenario, Multiple radar signals of various
types, which are operating over multiple frequency range and imping-
ing from all over the sphere pose threat for survivability of host Air-
craft.The scenario poses challenges in all the three domains,Viz.Time,
frequency and spatial.In this Internship project Amplitude compari-
sion method for AoA estimation is Explored.various practical consider-
ations,implementation aspects and simulation studies has been under-
taken from a practical perspective.
